# Binary Search

It is used for sorted list of elements. It has O(log n) time complexity which is better than linear search.

# Linear Search

It is used for un-sorted and un-ordered small list of elements. It has O(n) time complexity that is dependent on the number of list elements which is not very good and also not that bad.
